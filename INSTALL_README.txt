Merge/Overwrite the Gamedata and Ship folders in your main KSP directory with the ones from this mod.

NOTE: This mod is compatible with my other mod's scaling by default if you have DECQ, FASA or OLDD Saturn V you need to install the module manager compatibility patches below.


First download Module Manager here: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219

-If you have DECQ, FASA or OLDD Saturn V's also install the corresponding modulemanager configs and Ship craft files included in this mod package. ONLY USE ONE MODULE MANAGER CONFIG AT A TIME!
